Private Events

You want to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.

Deliverables

1. The User should be able to create an event.
2. The Users page should render all of the users. Each User should have a link to it's page with the information of his name and created events.
3. The events page should show all the created events and each event should link to it's user.
4. The event page should be able able to update and delete an event.
